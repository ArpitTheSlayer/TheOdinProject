      recipes that only requires a few key ingredients. Its made with a good

      <li>2 onions medium to large-sized</li>
      <li>1 cup gram flour (besan) or chickpea flour</li>
      <li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder optional</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)</li>
      <li>
        1 generous pinch asafoetida (hing) optional or use gluten-free
        asafoetida
      </li>
      <li>1 pinch baking soda optional</li>
      <li>

      <li>salt as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice the onions thinly and take them in a mixing bowl. Also, add
        chopped green chillies.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not have green chillies, then add red chilli powder. You can
        also add chopped coriander leaves if you want.
      </li>
      <li>Add the spices carom seeds, turmeric powder, asafoetida and salt.</li>
      <li>
        Mix everything well. Cover and keep the onion, chillies and spice
        mixture aside for 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The onions would release water and then you can add water as required in
        the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add gram flour (besan). If you plan to add baking soda, then add at this
        step.
      </li>
      <li>Add the required amount of water to make medium-thick batter.</li>
      <li>
        Stir the whole mixture very well with a spoon or with your hands. The
        batter is ready to be fried.
      </li>
      <li>In hot oil, add spoonfuls of the batter.</li>
      <li>
        Depending on the size of the kadai or pan, you can add less or more.
        Just make sure you do not over crowd the onion pakoda while frying.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pakora are a bit cooked, turn over with a slotted spoon and
        continue to fry.
      </li>
      <li>You will have to turn them a few times for even frying.</li>
      <li>Fry them till they look crisp and golden.</li>
      <li>
        Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper towels for excess
        oil to be absorbed.
      </li>
      <li>In the same oil fry slit green chilies.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle some salt on the green chilies and mix well.</li>
      <li>
        Serve onion pakoda with the fried green chilies or coriander chutney or
        tomato sauce.
